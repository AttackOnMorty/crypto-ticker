> [!NOTE]
> **Why isn't this on the App Store?**

1. Download and unzip **`CryptoTicker.zip`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/AttackOnMorty/crypto-ticker/releases).
2. Move **CryptoTicker** to your **Applications** folder.

   - Click **"Open Anyway"** to trust the app.

Now you're all set! ðŸš€

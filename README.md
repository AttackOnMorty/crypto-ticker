## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not in the App Store?**  
> Because publishing apps cost money, and I’d rather HODL my crypto.

1. Download and unzip **`CryptoTicker.zip`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/AttackOnMorty/crypto-ticker/releases).
2. Move **CryptoTicker** to your **Applications** folder.
3. Open the app. macOS will likely complain that this app is "unverified."
   - Go to **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy**.
   - Under the **Security** section, find the warning about **CryptoTicker**.
   - Click **"Open Anyway"** to trust the app.
